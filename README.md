# Sugoii-Pet-Hotel

## Project Introduction 
The Sugoii-Pet-Hotel is a project developed as part of my coursework during my time at the institute. The inspiration for this project originates from the growing travel demand in the post-COVID era. Our goal is to establish a comprehensive pet hotel system to serve individuals planning trips to foreign countries while encountering difficulties in arranging suitable care for their pets. Furthermore, we offer a pet matching system, enabling pet enthusiasts to find their ideal companions.
